## Assembly
1. **Tools: Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor** Setup raspberry pi with latest OS and python 3.7+ (already pre-installed)
2. **Tools: Soldering Iron (optional)** Assemble the components according to the [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices) guide. Soldering optional under step 6.
3. Continue following the Adafruit software setup until complete.

## Setup
1. Clone/download repository. Enter that directory using `cd <the path of the repository you just cloned>`.
2. Obtain API token by [signing up on MTA](https://api.mta.info/#/signup) and generating a token for GTFS-rt
3. Run `make` to install dependencies and generate `config.py`
4. Edit `config.py` to paste in the API token, and set up the `stops` array as follows: `Stop(LineID.<train>, "<stop>", <distance in minutes from station>)`. `<train>` is A, C, E, L, 7, etc. (I'm not quite sure how to get 7 express trains), `<stop>` is the stop ID _with direction_ obtained from [this list](https://github.com/Andrew-Dickinson/nyct-gtfs/blob/master/nyct_gtfs/gtfs_static/stops.txt), and `<distance in minutes from station>` is used to filter out trains that arrive too soon for you to be concerned.
5. Run with the following commands: `chmod +x platform3/platform3.py` (enables execution), `sudo su` (elevates privilege to run low level hardware stuff), `platform3/platform3.py` (runs the program).
